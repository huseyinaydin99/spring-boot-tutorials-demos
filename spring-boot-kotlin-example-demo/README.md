# What are the advantages of Kotlin over Java?
Kotlin is derived from the java language and inherits its advantage and overcomes its limitations. Below are some advantages of kotlin over java.

•	Concise - Drastically reduce the amount of boilerplate code.

•	Safe - Avoid entire classes of errors such as null pointer exception.

•	Lazy-Loading - The lazy-loading feature basically increases the startup time, which is very useful when using Kotlin for Android app development. In simple words, it’s the best solution for all developers who wants to reduce their Android app startup time so that their apps’ content can be shown faster •	Interoperable - One of the major as well as best features of Kotlin is its deep interoperability with Java. This, in fact, has attracted many Java developers as well as Android app developers to learn Kotlin

•	Extension - Extensions of Kotlin are very useful because they allow developers to add methods to classes without making changes to their source code. Just like Scala’s implicit methods, in Kotlin you can add methods on a per-user basis to classes

•	Tool friendly - Choose any java IDE or build from command line.

Companies like Pinterest, Uber, Evernote and Coursera, etc. are using kotlin languages in many parts of application program and apps.
